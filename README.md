<b> Please note : the v0.0.1 was shit. We're planning to rewrite it differently.</b>
<b> Please also note that this version is an alpha. it may crash and break your device. </b>
<p> This tool was developed by our hands, however, the way it works is inspired from <a href='https://haxi0-dev.com/FilzaTutorials/'> this guide by haxi0</a>. This mean you can do it manually with your own carrier.</p>
<h2> Instructions !</h2>
<li>1. Put the current carrier name you want to change in the field </li>
<li>2. Put the future carrier name in the 2nd field </li>
<li>3. Apply, then restart </li>
<br>
<p> DONE ! </p>
